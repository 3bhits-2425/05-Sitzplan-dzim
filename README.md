We created a Sitplan with tables and chairs as prefabs, 
and students. The students we created got specific characteristics
for example eyecolour, sound which describes them and the role in the class.

Things I learned in this project.
- How to create a prefab and change it shapes, add something to it and apply the changes.
- How to use GetComponent<>(); and what it does.
